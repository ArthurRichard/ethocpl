# ethos-over-cpl
Modified RIOT-OS ethos driver allowing IPv6 communication over PLC using the ST7580 IC.

Derived from https://riot-os.org/api/group__drivers__ethos.html

For now, requires ST7580 module: https://github.com/ArthurRichard/ST7580-RIOT-OS

Still needs A LOT of work done to turn it into an independent RIOT-OS kernel module.
